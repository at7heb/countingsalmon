# countingsalmon
count salmon -- there are places in this world where humans count salmon. Seems like a good job for a computer with a vision system and a model that detects salmon.
Would be nice items:
* estimate size
* identify injuries
* generalize to other species
* multiple environments

This is a placeholder; my vision is currently much broader than my capabilities.
