# countingsalmon
count salmon -- there are places in this world where humans count salmon. Seems like a good job for a computer with a vision system and a model that detects salmon.
Would be nice items:
* estimate size
* identify injuries
* generalize to other species
* multiple environments

This is a placeholder; my vision is currently much broader than my capabilities.

This project is inspired by a visit to a salmon ladder where the salmon were counted as they swam in a narrow channel formed by a concrete wall and some glass.
A human has to do the counting.
I talked with the human who currently does the counting, explaining that implementing software to count the salmon would be a fun project.
I asked if the job would be lost if a computer did the counting instead of a human.
The counter said no, and wasn't concerned about a computer possibly taking on a job now performed by a human.
